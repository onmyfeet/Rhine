In the year 9 AD, in the wooded hills of Teutoburg Forest, three Roman legions under the command of Publius Quinctilius Varus were ambushed by Germanic forces led by the traitor Arminius. In a day, a night and a day, the entire Roman force -- officers, legionaries, auxiliaries and camp followers -- was destroyed. All in all, close to 20,000 Romans and Roman allies were slaughtered, and left dead in the cold rainy mud. 
Afterwards, the river Rhine came to delineate the Northern border of the Empire in Western Europe. The Romans built fortifications along its shores and never again made any serious attempt to subdue the lands beyond.
